In this homework, we will use the cancer dataset.(Note: You can use the built-in 
function from ML libraries for gradient descent, training, and validation.) Also, sample 
code for accessing and cleaning up the dataset provided in Canvas. For the evaluation of 
this homework across all problems, use 80%, 20% split.

 

Problem 1 (40pts):

Use the cancer dataset to build a Naïve Bayesian model to classify the type of cancer 
(Malignant vs. benign). Plot your classification accuracy, precision, and recall. Explain and 
elaborate on your results. Can you compare your results against the logistic regression 
classifier you did in previous homework.

 

Problem 2 (40pts):

Use the cancer dataset to build a logistic regression model to classify the type of cancer 
(Malignant vs. benign). Use the PCA feature extraction for your training. Perform N 
number of independent training (N=1, …, K). Identify the optimum number of K, principal 
components that achieve the highest classification accuracy. Plot your classification 
accuracy, precision, and recall over a different number of Ks. Explain and elaborate on 
your results.

 

Problem 3 (20pts):

Can you repeat problem 2? This time, replace logistic regression with the Bayes 
classifier. Report your results (classification accuracy, precision, and recall). Compare 
your results against problem 2.
