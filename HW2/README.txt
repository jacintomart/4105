In this homework, we will use the Diabetes dataset and Cancer dataset. (Note: You can use the built-in function from ML libraries for gradient descent, training, and validation.)

 

Problem 1 (20 points)

Using the diabetes dataset, build a logistic regression binary classifier for positive diabetes. 
Please use 80% and 20% split between training and evaluation (test). 
Make sure to perform proper scaling and standardization before your training. 
Report your results, including accuracy, precision, and recall. At the end, plot the confusion
 matrix representing your binary classifier. 

 

Problem 2 (20 points)

Repeat problem 1, and this time use K-fold cross-validation for your training and validation. 
Perform the training two times for K=5 and K=10. Analyze and compare your average accuracy against problem 1.

 

Problem 3 (30pts):

Use the cancer dataset to build a logistic regression model to classify the type of cancer (Malignant vs. benign).
First, create a logistic regression that takes all 30 input features for classification. 
Please use 80% and 20% split between training and evaluation (test). Make sure to perform proper scaling and 
 standardization before your training. Report your results, including accuracy, precision, and recall. 
At the end, plot the confusion matrix representing your binary classifier. 
How about adding weight penalty here, considering the number of parameters. Add the weight penalty and repeat 
 the training and report the results.
 

Problem 4 (30pts):

1. Repeat problem 3, and this time use K-fold cross-validation for your training and validation. 
Perform the training two times for K=5 and K=10. Analyze and compare your average accuracy against problem 3. 

2. How about adding weight penalty here, considering the number of parameters. 
Add the weight penalty and repeat the training and report the average accuracy.
